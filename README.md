## Key aspects to improve on developing this project
- Improved usability for saving and loading user-generated line data
- Optional grid overlay within the canvas for precision drawing
- Support for algorithmic and mathematically generated lines
- Integration of RESTful API CRUD operations for secure server-side data storage

## Goal intended
To develop an interactive line drawing application that supports both free-hand drawing and mathematically driven line generation, with applications in calculus, linear algebra, and visual experimentation.
